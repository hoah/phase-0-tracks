table 1 = businesses
table 2 = users
table 3 = reviews

- You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

- There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT users.firstname, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM businesses JOIN users ON businesses.id = users.id JOIN reviews ON users.id = reviews.id;

- How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

SELECT users.firstname, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM businesses JOIN users ON businesses.id = users.id JOIN reviews ON users.id = reviews.id WHERE businesses.name="Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel";
