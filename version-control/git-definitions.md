# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
It enables us to keep track of changes to our work projects from multiple sources preventing conflicts.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch let's us make additions and modifications to a project while keeping the master branch isolated until a merge is determined to be safe.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is as it's name implies, you are committing your work after changes and testing to ensure you are minimizing bugs in your programming. A good commit message is one that gives you the appropriate information about the changes you made.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when there are changes that can not be automatically resolved by Git.
