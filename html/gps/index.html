What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	HTML5 semantic tags allows for building the structure of the html file and readability for other web developers. I think the header, main, and footer will aid in webpage structuring.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	The order will be normall left to right and top to bottom.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	Sulbime is a very useful text editor that will aide in writing code and you can customize it to your needs. Yes, I will be creating snippets later when I see the need.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	Determining how to create new snippets would have been hard if our guide did not step in and help us to understand what we were seeing. It would be helpful if we had some reference material to learn from.
